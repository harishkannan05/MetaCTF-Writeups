# Solution
We are given an image with the text  
`Help! 4V FH 246 677`  

Checking google if these characters are some coordinates reveals that it is a **Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) Coordinate.**  
Using a MGRS to Lat/Long converter like [this site](https://legallandconverter.com/p50.html), we can get the precise location.
